Change the version in the properties (F4 not RMB) of the Helios Installer project - MSI requires ##.##.#### so change it to something in this format otherwise the installer will not build.

Open the .MSI with Orca and 
		change the "File" "Version" to the same ##.##.####.#### that we have used for the other projects.
		change the "MsiAssemblyName" "Version" to the same ##.##.####.#### that we have used for the other projects.
		change the "Property" "ProductVersion" to the same ##.##.####.#### that we have used for the other projects.
		change the "UPGRADE" "VersionMin" to the same ##.##.####.#### that we have used for the other projects.

	Correct any welcome text issues in "Control" eg  "WelcomeText".  Copy the original text into a text editor, save it as a file and then "Import Text File"
	
	
Note: The Assembly file version information is saved as a set of integers for each portion of the numbering system, with the result that
		any leading zeros will always be lost!

Helios is a virtual cockpit simulator system for aircraft in the DCS World.  With Helios, you can create virtual cockpits, which allow you to increase your immersion in your favourite combat aircraft.  Helios profiles can be created to allow you to simulate switches, knobs, gauges and more complex instruments which can then be mapped into DCS to give you a much improved combat pilot experience.  Many people use a touch screen monitor with their virtual cockpits.   It is also possible to run the Helios cockpit on a remote PC.

Helios was originally created by Craig "Gadroc" Courtney.  Gadroc donated his code to the open source community and this code is currently delivered out of the BlueFinBima fork on Github. 

=======================

In addition to the functionality that many know and love, this release contains an interface for the AV-8B and a partial interface for the MiG-21, the latter being contributed by "Cylution".  Additionally there is now an interface for the F/A-18C Hornet, and simple interfaces for the Mirage 2000C as well as the Mi-8.  The latter pair are prototype code.  The Changelog.txt distributed with the release describes the changes to Helios.

The rate of growth in the number of aircraft in DCS means that unless there are many more contributors to the Helios project, there will not be an interface for every aircraft type, however this release includes a generic aircraft interface that is designed to allow profile designers such as the remarkable Capt Zeen ( http://www.captzeen.com/helios/index.asp ) to more easily develop profiles for new aircraft.

and a video tutorial demonstrating Installing Helios for beginners is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n1cL1Szgmg

Tutorials about creating profiles can be viewed https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dcs+helios+tutorial and Gadroc's site at http://www.gadrocsworkshop.com/downloads/ still exists which contains profiles, older information and files relating to Helios.
